# ğŸ“ˆ STOCK MARKET SIMULATOR ğŸ“ˆ
A realistic virtual stock market game built with C# and Windows Forms. Designed for educational use, data visualization and entertainment.

# Application Description:
  The user can start a new simulation or continue an existing one. The game begins with 10 000 $. During the simulation, the user can buy one or more stocks and cash out stocks theyâ€™ve already purchased. There      are 10 different stocks, each with a different value. The simulation lasts for 5 days and during this period, global events may occur that significantly affect certain stocks. After the 5 days are over, the       player   will see their final results and statistics.

# Purpose of the Application:
  The goal of this project is to simulate a virtual stock market where users can buy and sell stocks, track real-time price changes using charts, and make strategic decisions. The user is given the opportunity to   experience a stock market that is close to real-world behaviorâ€”without any financial risk.

# How the Application Works:
  The application retrieves data from databases. It uses tables for users, user-owned assets, user stock status, transactions, and stock prices, which change throughout the simulation.
  The project is designed so that once a playerâ€™s simulation ends, all unnecessary data is deleted to prevent the tables from becoming overloaded.
